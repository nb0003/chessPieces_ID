## General Information 
I trained a ML model to accurately identify which chess piece was presented in an image (king, queen, knight, bishop, pawn, rook). I used Python (in Google Colab) and the fastai (v2) library. I applied ML methods such as transfer learning, freezing/unfreezing, and discriminative learning rates. 

This notebook walks through the development of a simple Convolutional Neural Net which classifies images depicting chess pieces.

## Technology 
This project was created in Colab (using Python 3.6). Among other libraries, it uses:
* Fastai v2
* Torchvision
* Pillow (version 7.0.0)
* Matplotlib

## Setup 
For best viewing experience, please read the notebook directly in Colab.

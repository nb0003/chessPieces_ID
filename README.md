Chess Piece Identification Using Machine Learning 

I trained a ML model to accurately identify which chess piece was presented in an image (king, queen, knight, bishop, pawn, rook). I used Python (in Google Colab) and the fastai (v2) library. I applied ML methods such as transfer learning, freezing/unfreezing, and discriminative learning rates.
